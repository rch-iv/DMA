# Guidelines for Contributors

These guidelines are designed to help new and experienced developers contribute effectively to the DMA protocol. We believe in collaborative, community-driven development that is open, transparent, and focused on our core mission.

### 1. Core Principles  

Our work is guided by these principles. All contributions should align with them:

- User Sovereignty: The user's relationship with their AI is their own. The protocol should always prioritize user data ownership and control.
- Trust and Transparency: The protocol must be verifiable and auditable. We favor solutions that are cryptographically secure and open to public scrutiny.
- Platform Independence: The protocol should work with any LLM, now and in the future, without vendor lock-in.

### 2. Getting Started  

- Clone the Repo: Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine.
- Check the Issues: Before starting new work, please check the issues page to see what tasks are already in progress or have been identified as priorities.
- Start Small: If this is your first time contributing, we recommend starting with a small task like documentation updates, bug fixes, or minor feature requests.

### 3. Submitting Contributions  

- Fork the Repository: Fork the repo and create a new branch for your work.
- Write a Clear Commit Message: We follow the conventional commits specification. Your commit messages should clearly state what you did and why.
- Create a Pull Request (PR): When your code is ready, create a pull request. Your PR description should explain the changes you made, reference any relevant issues, and include screenshots or video clips if applicable.
- Wait for Review: The core team will review your PR. Be prepared for feedback and be willing to iterate on your work.
