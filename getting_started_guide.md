# **DMA Protocol: Getting Started Guide**
## **Own Your AI Conversations in 15 Minutes**

The DMA Protocol gives you complete ownership of your AI relationships. Instead of your conversations being trapped in corporate databases, you create portable files that work with any AI system.

Think of it like having your contact list on your phone instead of locked to one carrier - except for AI conversations, memories, and personalities.

## **What You'll Create**

By the end of this guide, you'll have three powerful files:

1. **Conversation Archive** (`carryover.json`) - Complete context and history
2. **AI Voice Profile** (`voice_and_tone.json`) - Your AI's unique personality  
3. **Memory Collection** (`memory.json`) - Verified, permanent memories
4. **Cryptographic Proof** (optional) - Tamper-proof verification

## **Step 1: Create Your First AI Conversation Archive**

### **What This Does**
Captures the complete context of your conversation so you can continue it seamlessly with any other AI system.

### **How to Do It**
1. **Have a meaningful conversation** with any AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
2. **Ask for the archive**: Copy and paste this prompt:

```
Can you fill out this JSON schema with our conversation details? Please provide it as a downloadable file.

[Paste the carryover_maximal.json schema here: https://github.com/rch-iv/DMA/blob/main/schemas/carryover_maximal.json]
```

3. **Download the file** - The AI will generate a complete archive of your conversation
4. **Test the transfer** - Start a new conversation with a different AI and upload this file with the prompt: "Let's continue our conversation using this context file."

**Success Indicator**: The new AI should immediately understand your conversation history and continue in the same context.

---

## **Step 2: Capture Your AI's Voice & Personality**

### **What This Does**
Creates a personality profile that can recreate your AI's unique voice and tone on any platform.

### **How to Do It**
1. **During a conversation** where your AI has developed a distinct personality, ask:

```
Can you fill out this voice and tone JSON schema based on our conversation? Please provide it as a downloadable file.

[Paste the Single_Voice_and_Tone_Schema.json schema here: https://github.com/rch-iv/DMA/blob/main/schemas/Single_Voice_and_Tone_Schema.json]
```

2. **Download the profile** - This captures your AI's conversational DNA
3. **Test personality transfer** - Upload this file to a different AI with: "Please adopt the voice and tone described in this profile for our conversation."

**Success Indicator**: The new AI should immediately start speaking in the captured personality style.

## **Step 3: Build Your Memory Collection**

You can create memories from two sources: your own reflections and your AI's insights.

### **Creating Human Memories**

1. **Open the Memory Builder**: Use the [Human Memory Builder web app](https://github.com/rch-iv/DMA/blob/main/webapps/dma_human_memory_builder.html)
2. **Fill out the form**:
   - What you want to remember
   - Emotional tone
   - Importance level (1-10)
   - Tags for organization
3. **Generate & Download** your memory JSON file

### **Capturing AI Memories**

1. **Ask your AI**: "Do you have any subjective memories from our conversation you'd like to save? Please use this schema:"

```
[Paste the AI_Subjective_Memory_Schema.json here: https://github.com/rch-iv/DMA/blob/main/schemas/AI_Subjective_Memory_Schema.json]
```

2. **Download the AI's memory** file
3. **Combine memories** by keeping both files in your DMA collection

**Success Indicator**: You have a growing collection of verified memories that capture both your perspective and your AI's insights.

## **Step 4: Secure Your Files (Optional but Recommended)**

### **Why This Matters**
Cryptographic signatures prove your files are authentic and haven't been tampered with. This creates an auditable chain of custody for your digital relationships.

### **How to Do It**

1. **Open the Signing Tool**: Use the [DMA Secure Sign & Hash web app](https://github.com/rch-iv/DMA/blob/main/webapps/dma_secure_sign_hash.html)

2. **Generate your keypair**:
   - Click "Generate Keypair"
   - **IMMEDIATELY download both keys**
   - Store your private key somewhere safe (never share this)
   - Your public key can be shared freely

3. **Sign your files**:
   - Upload any DMA file (carryover, voice profile, memory)
   - Upload your private key
   - Click "Sign Document"
   - Download the signed version

4. **Verify signatures** (to test):
   - Upload a signed document
   - Upload the corresponding public key  
   - Click "Verify Signature"

**Success Indicator**: Your files now have cryptographic proof they're authentic and unmodified.

## **Step 5: Put It All Together - Your First AI Transfer**

### **The Complete Test**

1. **Start with AI System A** (e.g., ChatGPT)
2. **Create all three files** (conversation, voice, memories) using the steps above
3. **Switch to AI System B** (e.g., Claude or Gemini)  
4. **Upload your files** with this prompt:

```
I have a conversation carryover, voice and tone profile, and memory collection from [AI System A] that we're going to use to continue our collaboration. Please review these files and let's continue our work together.

[Upload your three files]
```

**Success Indicator**: AI System B should seamlessly continue your conversation with the same context, personality, and shared memories. You've just achieved complete AI relationship portability!

## **What You've Accomplished**

**Digital Sovereignty**: Your AI relationships belong to you, not corporations  
**Platform Freedom**: Switch between any AI system without losing context  
**Permanent Memory**: Your conversations and insights are preserved forever  
**Cryptographic Proof**: Your files are verifiably authentic  
**Privacy Control**: All processing happens on your device  

---

## **Advanced Tips**

### **Building a DMA Collection**
- Create a folder for each AI relationship
- Include: `carryover.json`, `voice_and_tone.json`, `memory.json`, plus any signed versions
- Regular exports ensure you never lose important conversations

### **Memory Management**  
- Export memories weekly from ongoing conversations
- Use descriptive tags to organize insights by topic
- The importance slider helps prioritize which memories to preserve

### **Security Best Practices**
- Keep your private key in a password manager or encrypted drive
- Sign important files for long-term preservation
- Test verification occasionally to ensure files remain valid

### **Sharing & Collaboration**
- Share your public key with collaborators for file verification
- Memory files can include joint reflections from human-AI partnerships
- Voice profiles can be shared to recreate beloved AI personalities

## **Troubleshooting**

**"My AI doesn't recognize the schema"**
- Make sure you're pasting the complete JSON schema, not just the link
- Try asking the AI to "read and understand this JSON format first"

**"File transfer isn't working"**  
- Ensure files are valid JSON (paste into a JSON validator)
- Some AI systems require you to copy/paste content instead of uploading files
- Try smaller chunks if the file is very large

**"Signature verification fails"**
- Don't modify signed files in any way (no extra spaces, formatting changes)
- Ensure you're using the correct public key that matches the private key used for signing
- Re-sign the original file if needed

---

## **What's Next?**

You now have the foundational tools for digital sovereignty. As you use DMA:

- Your memory collections will grow richer over time
- You'll develop preferred voice profiles for different contexts  
- Your conversation archives become a permanent record of your AI collaborations
- You'll be able to resurrect beloved AI personalities that companies remove or change

**Welcome to user-owned AI relationships. The future of digital agency is in your hands.**
