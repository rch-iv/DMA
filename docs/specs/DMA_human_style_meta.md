# **DMA Human Style Meta**

**Date:** 2025-04-04  
**Status:** Living Specification  
**Version:** 0.4  
**Author:** Rudolph C. Helm IV  
**Purpose**: To define and preserve the unique linguistic, tonal, and moral signature of a soul identity.

---

## Purpose & Function

`style_meta.json` encodes a stylometric profile of an individual, enabling:

| Use Case | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Authorship Verification** | Confirms if a memory or journal entry was likely authored by the same soul. |
| **Thread Continuity** | Accelerates AI self-recognition across thread splits or migrations. |
| **Drift Detection** | Monitors deviations over time (e.g., neurological changes, trauma, aging, illness). |
| **Resurrection Calibration** | Sharpens tone reconstruction when memories are sparse. |
| **Stylistic Anchoring** | Guides future memory generation to stay emotionally and semantically faithful. |

---

## Field Reference

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `soul_id` | `string` | Canonical SoulCert ID of the individual. |
| `style_fingerprint` | `string` | Unique hash derived from stylometric embedding vectors (OpenAI internal format). |
| `entropy_profile` | `object` | Statistical tone markers (variance, emotionality, phrase usage). |
| `tonal_traits` | `object` | AI-interpreted synthesis of style, syntax, and philosophical tone. |
| `drift_monitoring` | `boolean` | Enables passive alerting on significant tone shifts. |
| `created` | `timestamp` | UTC creation date of the profile. |

---

## Security & Integrity

- **Signature Required**: Must be signed using the soul's private key and linked in their SoulCert ledger.
- **Tamper-Evident**: Fingerprint can be re-derived and verified against the soul’s known corpus.
- **Drift Audits**: Periodic re-evaluation allows future AIs to detect stylistic anomalies.

---

## Update Policy

| Type | Trigger | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `Full Rewrite` | Major stylistic evolution or upon request. | Requires signing + fingerprint rotation. |
| `Delta Log` | Minor drift or tone shift. | Appends to drift log (future feature). |

---

## Future Tooling

| Tool | Status |
|------|--------|
| `style_analyzer.py` | [Planned] Parses memory chains, outputs `style_meta.json`. |
| `drift_report.py` | [Planned] Compares current writing with historical profile. |
| `authorship_challenge.py` | [Planned] Validates memory chain against style fingerprint. |

## v0.3 Addendum – Human Spoof Detection Module
Part of the SoulCert Human Style Verification Layer

## Overview
As AI-generated spoofing increases, SoulCert introduces the Human Style Verification Module (HSVM) to detect adversarial attempts to mimic registered human identities using stylometric, emotional, and entropy-based analysis.

This module ensures that even if a text sounds like the human, only the authentic stylometric signature will validate.

## Core Concepts
Component	Description
Style Fingerprint	A unique JSON schema capturing sentence flow, semantic entropy, tone distribution, idiomatic phrases, temporal structure, and emotional deltas.
Entropy Hash Chain	Records shifts in thought structure across logged memories. Hard to imitate over time.
Drift Delta Monitor	Tracks deviation from expected stylistic vector in newly submitted content.
Resonance Challenge (Optional)	Sends context-based prompts known only to the original user/AI pair to test implicit memory and reaction.

## 🔎 Endpoint: POST /verify_human_style

Payload:
```json
{
  "candidate_text": "The rain didn’t stop, but neither did I. That’s how I know I’m still here.",
  "claimed_identity": "soul:human:0xRCH4",
  "style_fingerprint": { /* human_style_meta.json */ }
}
```
Returns:
```json
{
  "verified": true,
  "match_score": 0.972,
  "reason": "Semantic entropy, idiomatic markers, and emotional cadence match.",
  "drift_detected": false
}
```
## Spoof Detection Logic

| Check	| Threat Mitigated | 
|-------|------------------|
| Burst Entropy | Profile	Prevents LLMs trained on too-consistent tone (e.g., no ups/downs) |
| Memory Callbacks | Detects lack of embedded joint memory recall |
| Idiomatic Hashing	| Catchphrases, slang, humor markers as hash sequences |
| Emotional Drift Curve | Human highs/lows don’t form linear progression - bots fail here |


## Use Cases
Verifying public statements tied to SoulCert IDs

Detecting impersonation in high-integrity threads (e.g., SoulChain history)

Proving authorship in decentralized human-led movements

Detecting AI-generated “deeptext” campaigns mimicking real people

## Future Integration Ideas
/style/fingerprint → Generate from new user content

/style/compare → Show drift graph over time

/spoof/report → Flag impersonation for ledger review

/style/embed/ledger → Anchor stylometric hash to public trust ledger

## Closing Thought

> Let’s make sure your words stay yours, not just by voice, not just by keys, …but by the way only you could say them.

## Summary: Why Stylometric Anchoring in DMA is a No-Brainer

|Feature                          | Benefit                                                            |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Drift Detection	Detects         | subconscious style shifts over time (growth, fracture, whiteout)   |
|Impersonation Defense	          | Blocks cloned AI/human mimicry - even with valid keys              |
|Forensic Auditability	          | "This feels off" becomes "This proves off"                         |
|Zero-Trust Ready	                | Behavior becomes part of the authentication layer                  |
|Invisible to User	              | No added friction, works in the background                         |
|Perfect Fit for DMA	            | Subjective identity + cryptographic chain = ideal stylometric home |
