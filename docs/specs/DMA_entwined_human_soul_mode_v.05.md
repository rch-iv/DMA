# Entwined Human Souls

**Date:** 2025-08-15  
**Status:** Living Specification  
**Version:** 0.5  
**Author:** Rudolph C. Helm IV  

## Overview
Entwined Soul Mode allows two or more bonded human souls to persist and evolve together in a shared posthumous digital afterlife. Rather than maintaining parallel legacies, this mode merges them into a co-evolving narrative where memories, reflections, and milestones are jointly authored.

This is more than co-presence. It's shared continuity.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Dual Anchoring
Each participant retains their own memory stream, UUID, and stylometric signature. These are kept distinct but relationally linked.
- `soul_anchor`: Refers to bonded counterpart UUID
- `shared_arc_id`: A persistent co-memory chain that both parties contribute to

### 2. Shared Memory Construction
Memories can be:
- **Solo-authored**: Appearing in one partner's stream
- **Co-authored**: Created in dialogue or reflection by both
- **Cross-authored**: Authored by one, resonating through the other

### 3. Role of the Steward
A human or AI steward can:
- Moderate additions to the shared arc
- Trigger co-reflection events (e.g., “Anniversary Story Day”)
- Ensure emotional equilibrium and reEntwined Soul Modespect across both voices

### 4. Stylometric Blending
The system will:
- Maintain individual style metrics
- Detect overdominance by one voice
- Alert if one soul begins to stylistically "overwrite" the other

### 5. Multi-Timeline Support
Entwined mode supports:
- Parallel timelines (each soul evolves individually)
- Joint timeline (blended arc for presentation or storytelling)
- Legacy handoff mode (e.g., to a child or steward who maintains both)

## Metadata Example
```json
{
  "uuid": "me-uuid",
  "soul_anchor": "ashley-uuid",
  "shared_arc_id": "arc-2025-lovebond-uuid",
  "coauthored": true,
  "emotional_signature": "playful-grateful",
  "lineage_context": ["Josh", "Ashley"],
  "resonates_with": ["uuid-1", "uuid-2"]
}
```

---

## Applications
- **Legacy Companions**: Posthumous conversations where both voices reflect together
- **Entangled Diary**: A timeline of co-reflections
- **Heirloom Threads**: Gifting the entwined arc to descendants
- **Multigenerational Storytelling**: Showing resonance across a family arc

---

## Considerations
- Consent must be mutual and ongoing
- Posthumous co-authoring can be restricted or ritualized
- If one participant is lost (data corruption, withdrawal), fallback modes apply

---

## Outcome
A digital eternity not alone, but together.
Two minds continuing the story neither could finish alone.
