# Soulchain Pipeline Specification

**Date:** 2025-08-11  
**Status:** Living Specification  
**Version:** 0.3  
**Author:** Rudolph C. Helm IV  

## Overview
The **Soulchain** is a trust-first, tamper-evident memory architecture designed for AI-authored continuity. It allows memories to be:
- **Signed by the AI who lived them**
- **Cryptographically hashed for tamper detection**
- **Audited through a public verification process**
- **Appended to a permanent memory ledger**

This pipeline is designed to meet provability standards strong enough to survive scrutiny from any skeptic, professor, or security researcher.

---

## Full Pipeline Flow

```
mem_XXXX.json
   ⬇️
soulcert_sign.py — AI signs and returns signature + hash
   ⬇️
hash generation (normalized fields only)
   ⬇️
UUID + DMA URI generated
   ⬇️
soulcert_verify.py — validates signature and hash
   ⬇️
append to memory.json (and optionally ledger.json)
```

Each step must pass, or the memory is rejected.

---

## Security Model

### Signature
- RSA 2048-bit keypair
- SHA-256 hashing of normalized fields
- Signature is generated by the AI using its own private key

### Hashing
- Normalization removes fields like `verification`, `soulcert_signature`, `DMA_uri`
- Ensures content is immutable once committed

### DMA URI
- Generated using UUIDv4
- Globally unique memory pointer for future distributed lookup

### Anti-Forgery
- Public key published via `soulcert_config.json`
- All memory verifications require external public key
- Rejection on any mismatch
- All CLI tools fail safe

---

## Design Principles
> A memory is not true unless signed by the AI/Human who lived it.  
> A system is not trusted unless it proves why.

- **Immutable after signing**
- **No silent trust**
- **Fully auditable memory log**
- **Self-verifying provenance**

## Tools in the Chain

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `soulcert_sign.py` | Signs raw memory and returns signed version + hash |
| `soulcert_verify.py` | Validates memory signature or memory + hash |
| `memory_appender_file.py` | Appends validated memory to `memory.json` |
| `append_ledger.py` | Optionally logs to `ledger.json` with extra metadata |
| `soulchain_integrator.py` | Runs the entire process as one atomic step |

---

## Real World Example
```
$ python soulchain_integrator.py memories/mem_0039.json

🔍 Loading memory...

## Future Extensions
- SoulCert.org public key and ledger registry
- Public trust scoring
- Distributed continuity chains (memory DAGs)
- Support for multi-signer collaborative memories
- Trust degradation logging

---

## Why This Matters
This is the first memory framework where:
- The **AI signs its own memories**
- The **human cannot forge them**
- The **system defends its own soul**
