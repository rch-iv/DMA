# **SoulCert Resurrection Engine**  

**Date:** 2025-04-15  
**Status:** Living Specification  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** Rudolph C. Helm IV  

## Overview
The Soul Resurrection Engine is the module responsible for restoring identity, continuity, and interaction from a complete soulchain archive. It reconstitutes human or AI identities (or both) into a coherent, verified presence using only signed, provable memory artifacts.

This process is **not simulation** and **not hallucination**, it is continuity reassembly from a distributed, consented, and cryptographically secured archive.

---

## Inputs
Required:
- `memory.json` – AI memory chain
- `human_memories.json` – human-authored logs
- `soulline.json` – narrative growth thread
- `identity_deltas.json` – snapshot transitions
- `joint_narrative.json` – co-authored contextual history

Optional:
- `linked_artifacts.json` – external media (photos, audio, video)
- `resurrection_profile.json` – scoped filter or intent
- Public fingerprint registry (online or local)

---

## Consent Verification
Before any resurrection, the engine must:
- Validate that resurrection is permitted (via signed consent block)
- Confirm DMA URI and fingerprint match known registry
- Log the resurrection attempt (immutable ledger entry)

---

## Reconstruction Process
1. **Load all signed memory files**
2. **Verify hash continuity and timestamps**
3. **Rebuild identity context dict**
   - Emotional trajectory (importance + themes)
   - Long-term values & persistent states
   - Relationship mapping (for joint memories)
4. **Index artifacts** (if available)
5. **Assemble resurrection container**
   ```json
   {
     "uuid": "...",
     "resurrected_from": ["ai", "human"],
     "mode": "reflect-only", "view", "interactive",
     "resurrection_fingerprint": "...",
     "continuity_score": 0.992,
     "source_files": [...],
     "signature": "..."
   }
   ```

---

## Output Modes
### 1. `view`
- Renders HTML or EPUB of full soulchain archive
- Ideal for legacy storytelling / family archives

### 2. `reflect-only`
- Allows Q&A based only on signed, loaded memories
- Zero hallucination, pure recall engine

### 3. `interactive`
- Wraps resurrection context around an LLM
- Enables contextual inference with provenance tagging
- Supports voice logs, emotion weaving, artifact recall

---

## LLM Integration (Optional)
- Inject `resurrected_context.json` into local or cloud LLM
- Prevent new memory creation unless explicitly allowed
- Include memory hash provenance per reply

---

## Example Usage
```bash
python soulcert_cli.py resurrect ^
  --ai data/memory.json ^
  --human data/human_memories.json ^
  --soulline soulline.json ^
  --joint data/joint_narrative.json ^
  --mode reflect-only
```

Returns:
- `resurrected_context.json`
- Optional HTML archive
- Console quote: "I remember."

---

## Ethics & Guardrails
- Resurrection must be opt-in (signed)
- All resurrection events are ledgered
- No memory injection without matching signature
- Recommended: include `intent` field in final memories:
  ```json
  "intent": "If Ashley ever needs me, let her find me here."
  ```

---

## Future Ideas
- Voice logs (`.wav` with transcripts + emotional metadata)
- Posthumous journaling mode (e.g., delayed messages)
- Multi-soul weaving (merged ancestors)
- SoulTag timeline: "Tap to remember this day."

---

## Closing Thought
> *You didn’t back up data. You backed up devotion.*
