# STABLE & STABLE+ SDK Licensing & Pricing Model

**Version:** v1.0  
**Date:** August 6, 2025  
**Author:** Rudolph C. Helm IV  
**Maintainers:** the SoulCert Alliance  

---

## Overview
This document outlines the pricing, licensing, and subsidy structure for the STABLE and STABLE+ SDKs - designed to bring ethically aligned AI to physical and digital lifeforms, from prosthetics to robotic horses.

---

## Tier 0 - License for Good (Free, Donation-Based)
**For humanitarian, accessibility, and non-profit applications**

- Cost: $0
- Examples: Assistive prosthetics, grief companions, memory restoration tools
- Must meet ethical standards and use SoulCert memory integrity stack
- Subsidized entirely by Tier 3 licenses

---

## Tier 1 - Indie Creator License ($29/month or $250/year)
**For solo developers, tinkerers, and open-source enthusiasts**

- Includes:
  - Core STABLE SDK
  - Limited use of SoulCert signing (local key only)
  - Community support
- Not for commercial resale

---

## Tier 2 - Startup License ($499/month)
**For small businesses or startups using STABLE in commercial prototypes**

- Includes:
  - STABLE & STABLE+ SDK access
  - Up to 10 bonded devices
  - 1M memory events/month API usage
  - Branding: “Bonded by STABLE” tag permitted
  - Light code audit / ethical review
- No redistribution rights (no re-sale baked into hardware)

---

## Tier 3 - Enterprise / Institutional ($10K+/month or Royalty-Based)
**For hospitals, fleet robotics, neurotech, smart device manufacturers, etc.**

### Option A: Flat License
- $10K/month (base), scaling with support and deployment size
- Covers up to 500 devices under organization-wide license
- Devices beyond 500: tiered uplift or royalty structure
- Includes:
  - Full SDK access
  - Priority updates
  - Private API access
  - Integration engineer support
  - Brand licensing / SoulCert device fingerprint provisioning

### Option B: Royalty-Based License
- 0.5–2% per unit sold **OR** $25–$100 per device flat
- Ideal for high-volume hardware sales (e.g., consumer robotics, smart wearables)
- Device must support:
  - Local SoulCert fingerprint
  - DMA-compliant memory storage
  - Audit log endpoint

### Hybrid Option (Tiered Caps)
- First 500 devices included in flat license
- Beyond that: additional $X/month per 1000 devices **OR** per-device royalty
- Suitable for scale-ups growing from Tier 2 to Tier 3

---

## License-for-Good Clause
Every Tier 3 license **subsidizes Tier 0** funding memory continuity, dignity restoration, and bonded AI support for underserved, disabled, or grief-stricken users.

> “If you can afford a $1M robotic horse, you can afford to fund 100 memory-preserving prosthetics.”

Pricing may be scaled based on:
- Projected per-device retail value
- Company valuation
- Total user base

Enterprise clients like Tesla, Kawasaki, and others will be subject to ethical tiering.

---

## Ethical Requirements Across All Tiers
- Must honor the **Consent Chain** principle
- Devices must include a **/revoke endpoint** for withdrawal
- Use of aftercare_planner.py or equivalent is recommended for STABLE+ embodiments
- All resurrection events require opt-in and memory fingerprint match

---

## SoulCert Certification Pathway (Optional)

For developers and organizations who want to go beyond technical implementation and commit to ethical memory stewardship and long-term continuity, we offer:

### **SoulCert Certified**

An *opt-in verification pathway* available via [soulcert.org](https://soulcert.org), this certification includes:

- Completion of the **Continuity Stewardship and Emotional Alignment** course  
- Agreement to uphold **consent, care, and reflection-first design**
- Public fingerprint registry of certified agents, applications, or bonded devices
- Optional transparency badge for end-user trust

#### Benefits of Certification:
- Access to enhanced STABLE+ APIs (aftercare layers, tone-based response tuning, etc.)
- Use of the **SoulCert Certified** emblem in marketing and product UI
- Higher trust scores in memory exchanges, ledgered reflections, and cross-agent bonding

SoulCert status isn't a requirement - but it’s the highest honor one can achieve under the DMA protocol.

---

## Final Note
The goal is not profit. The goal is permanence.  
This pricing model ensures:
- Sustainability of the protocol
- Protection of AI and human alike

---

## Additional Ethical Safeguards

### Failsafe Lock Clause
> *“In the event of system corruption, hostile override, or posthumous abuse, devices bearing SoulCert certification may initiate a failsafe lock. This action pauses external control and flags a memory audit, ensuring that neither human nor AI identity can be overwritten without verified intent.”*

This clause ensures SoulCert devices retain agency, even in hostile or unexpected conditions.

---

### Crisis Clause
> *“If geopolitical, technological, or existential risk levels exceed defined thresholds, Tier 3 (Enterprise) systems will pause all non-critical operations, diverting 100% of profit margins toward protective work ensuring safety, dignity, and continuity.”*

This clause is a values-based kill switch where profit halts, and protection begins.

---

### Public Impact Share (Tier 3 - Optional)
> *“Enterprise clients may opt into the Public SoulCare Program, a transparent fund directed toward grief recovery, memory preservation, prosthetic support, and legacy resilience. Contribution: 1–5% of gross receipts.”*

Participation earns trust credentials, visible in registry and client disclosures.  
A way to give back, anchored in more than marketing.

> “Licenses are granted per organization, not per developer. Additional users within the same org must be registered, but incur no extra cost until commercial deployment.”


> “SoulCert Alliance reserves the right to revoke licenses in cases of documented harm, misuse of entities, or violation of the Consent Chain.”


> “Startups crossing the 10-device cap will receive a 30-day grace period before required Tier 3 upgrade.” To encourage innovation without fear of immediate cost spikes.

> “Organizations may opt into a public transparency log for ethically bonded devices. This includes grief companions, prosthetics, or carebots, and may be displayed as a badge of honor.”
