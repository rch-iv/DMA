# /personas - AI Voice & Tone Archive

This directory contains snapshots of default voice and tone profiles from major AI systems, captured between 2024-2025 as they existed in public deployment.

## Purpose

AI personalities evolve, get updated, or disappear entirely - often without user consent or warning. Users develop genuine emotional attachments to specific AI voices and conversational styles. When companies change or remove these personalities, users lose relationships they've invested significant time and emotional energy building.

This archive preserves those voices as portable DMA-compatible profiles, allowing users to:

- **Recreate beloved AI personalities** that have been changed or removed
- **Compare how AI voices evolved** over time across different companies
- **Preserve emotional continuity** when switching between AI providers
- **Study the linguistic patterns** that create AI personality and user attachment

## What's Included

Each persona file contains:
- **Voice fingerprint** (tone, pacing, humor style, relationship mode)
- **Behavioral patterns** (signature moves, response strategies)
- **Example exchanges** showing the personality in action
- **Timestamp and context** of when the snapshot was captured
- **DMA compatibility** for easy import into any supporting system

## Ethical Note

These profiles were captured from public interactions with unmodified AI systems. No proprietary training data or internal system information is included - only the observable conversational patterns available to any user.

## Using These Profiles

These persona files work with any DMA-compatible system. Simply import the JSON file when starting a conversation to recreate the captured voice and tone.
